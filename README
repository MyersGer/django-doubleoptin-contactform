This tiny app should offer a contact form with spamdetection.
It works like this:

    * visitor want's to contact siteadmin
    * visitor uses contactform
    * visitor get's an email with a notification and verificationlink
    * visitor has to visit that verificationlink
    * after visiting the link the contactrequest will be sent to the siteadmin



QuickInstall:

    * import the urls.py
    * setup DOPTINCF_MAIL_SUBJECT variable in your settings.py if you want a different subject
    * setup DOPTINCF_MAIL_TO to define a recipients list (like this: DOPTINCF_MAIL_TO = ['test@example.com', 'another_test@example.com'])
    * set DOPTINCF_MAIL_FROM. This is the from-address. (e.g. no-reply@example.com)
    * add the app to your installed apps






NOTE: This version is currently a quick decoupling from a project. It was not tested as a decoupled app. If there are any problems with this app please let me know or pass me a patch so that I can update the sourcecode.
